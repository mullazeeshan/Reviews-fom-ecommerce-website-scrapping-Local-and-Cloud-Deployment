mobile,siddharth verma,5,Just wow!,I had to go for this one the time I lost my realme 3. This was my first choice and I'm glad I bought it. The camera quality is pretty amazing! Has everything a shutterbug would ever want in his camera phone: everything ranging from nightscape for bright-light clicks in the dark to chroma boost for enhancing the colors in it. A must for every beginner: I'd say!
mobile,Flipkart Customer,5,Best in the market!,awesome
mobile,Shashank Patil,5,Terrific,Absolutely loved the picture quality! For the price offered: realme 3i is definitely a great buy! The fact that it was written 8MP on the box packaging had me concerned for some time but when I reached out to realme and Flipkart: they confirmed that it was just a misprint on a few boxes: it really is of 13MP. Been using it for almost 4 days now and I must say: I'm pretty impressed! Also: great battery backup and commendable performance. Overall: realme 3i is the best in the price segment!
